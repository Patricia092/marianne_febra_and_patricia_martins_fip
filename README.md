<h1 align ="center">ZIMA</h1>

#### By Marianne "Mazz" Febra and Patricia Martins

ZIMA, the iconic clear alcoholic beverage, emerged during the 1980s as a pioneer trendsetter in the alcohol industry. Launched by the Coors Brewing Company in 1993, its transparent appearance and unique citrus taste perfectly echoed the era’s fascination with all things clear and pure. 

The distinctive branding that accompanied its debut made it a cultural phenomenon, attracting a wide consumer base. However, as the 80’s nostalgia waned and consumer preferences shifted, ZIMA’s popularity dwindled, leading to its discontinuation in the early 2000s.

A modern brand refresh is now vital to revitalize ZIMA’s identity, tapping into nostalgia while embracing contemporary sensibilities. By embracing sustainable practices, introducing fresh flavors, and leveraging digital marketing, the reimagined ZIMA can recapture the hearts of both old and new consumers, cementing its position as a refreshing and relevant choice in the competitive beverage landscape of today.
